      <h5>heroku's a beast.</h5>
      <p>as i began composing this piece, i actually wanted to know the meaning of heroku.
      in the past, i thought it was like some japanese ninja type shit. according to a more recent (2014)
      phd search, the phd comes up a few suggestions. first one, a nod to matz, the creator of ruby.
      second, to keep a tally of farts. oh, what up doe.</p>
      <p>
        with the heroku toolbelt installed, the necessary access to the heroku command
        line utility, as well as git, and foreman is now available. thank you master.
      </p>
      <p>
        i've configured 3 os x operating systems with heroku. i break shit, and try to fix it. ususally causing
        brain pain, but i love it. rinse, repeat. now with that said, let's head over to the terminal and get this shit set up.
      </p>
      <p>
        in the terminal, type <code>$ heroku login </code>, and login using the vituals used when logging into heroku.
        email, and password, right? either an ssh key has already been established, or a new one needs to be created.
        the <a href="https.www.heroku.com" target="_blank">99 nuggests</a> website has detailed instructions, as i've set
        up this website, just reminding either you or me to expedite if needing to configure another machine.
