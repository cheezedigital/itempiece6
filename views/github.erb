    <h4>all things github</h4>
    <p>
      i'll be installing github on a mac, so we'll be using the mac instructions.
    </p>
    <h4>github</h4>
      <li>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and create a profile. add an avatar, or atleast i did, so just a suggestion.</li>
      <li>let's start out by opening the terminal applicaiton and typing <strong>$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"</strong> with your name
      actually being your name. by doing this, we're actually telling git (locally) we say who we say we are.
      </li>
      <li>next: config email address so git knows which email is associated with commits.</li>
      <li><strong>$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"</strong></li>
        <h4>setting up your ssh keys</h4>
      <li>ssh keys are a way to identify trusted computers.</li>
      <p>to find out other than your github settings if ssh keys are established, open the terminal, and
        at the root path, which on the local is <strong>~$</strong> type ls -la. should display all directories on the local.
        you'll notice the .ssh. either change directories into .ssh, or open via an editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        to generate an ssh key, open up the terminal. again, the terminal should now be saved to the dock, and type
        in <strong>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"</strong> press enter. next, you'll be asked to enter a
        passphrase. make it unique, please, and don't forget it. the output generated should be a key fingerprint. then add the new
        key to the ssh-agent by typing <strong>$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"</strong>, then <strong>$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa</strong>
      </p>
