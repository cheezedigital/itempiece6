      <h5>first program</h5>
      <p>
        i recently started reading a book called learn how to program from chris pine,
        and what really struck a cord with me was how he wrote about preparing a peanut butter sammy. i never really
        think about all the steps when making a peanut butter sammy, as it just seems natural at this point in my life,
        however, i'm wrong. seriously wrong.
