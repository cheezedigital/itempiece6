  <p>
    i've spent the better part of the last decade in question. i spend massive amounts of time in my mind.
    i like to think about thinking. while on this path of discovery, i've found i'm passionate about
    all things web related. this shit has a heart, and most of the people in the community are pretty cool.
    i'm trying to hone my craft, and become what is known in the field, a unicorn.
